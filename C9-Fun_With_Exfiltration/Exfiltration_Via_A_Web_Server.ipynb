We'll automate the process of posting the encrypted document to an account on https://pastebin.com/. This will enable us to dead-drop the document and retrieve it when we want to without any-one else being able to decrypt it. By using a well-known site like __Pastebin__, we should also be able to bypass any blacklisting that a firewall or proxy may have, which might otherwise prevent us from just sending the document to an IP address or web server that we control. Let's start by putting some supporting functions into our exfiltration scirpt. Open up __paste_exfil.py__ and enter the following code:"
