        "Gaining access to a target network is only a part of the battle. To make use of your access, you want to be able to exfiltrate documents, spreadsheets, or other bits of data from the target system. Depending on the defense mechanisms in place, this last part of your attack can prove to be tricky.\n",
        "There might be local or remote systems (or a combination of both) that work to validate processes that open remote connections as well as determine whether those processes should be able to send information or initiate connections outside of the internal network.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we'll create tools that enable you to exfiltrate encrypted data. First, we'll write a script to encrypt and decrypt files. We'll then use that script to encrypt information and transfer it from the system by using three methods: Email, file transfers, and posts to a web server. For each of these methods, we'll write both a platform-independent tool and a Windows-only tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the Windows-only functions, we'll rely on the __PyWin32__ libraries we used in Chapter 8, especially the __win32com__ package. Windows __COM__ (Component Object Model) automation serves a number of practical uses, from interacting with network-based services to embedding a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet into your own application. All versions of Windows, beginning with XP, allow you to embed an Internet Explorer COM object into applications, and we'll take advantage of this ability in this chapter."

The __AES__ cipher is an example of symmetric encryption __[1]__: It's called __symmetric__ because it uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. It is very fast, and it can handle large amounts of text. That's the encryption method we will use to encrypt the information we want to exfiltrate.\n",

We will use this cipher to encrypt the single key used in the AES encryption. The asymmetric encryption is well suited to small bits of information, making it perfect for encrypting the AES key.\n",
