The __generator__ method is optional, but separating it from the __run__ method is a useful pattern you'll see in many plug-ins. By separating it and using it as a Python generator, you can get faster results and make your code easier to understand.\n",

That means that exploit writers cannot determine how the address space of the victim process is laid out at the time of attack. Windows Vista was the first Windows release with ASLR support. In older memory images like Windows XP, you won't see ASLR protection enabled by default. Now, with recent machines (Windows 10), almost all processes are protected.\n",
