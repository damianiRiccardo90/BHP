We'll create very simple code snippets that spawn a compiled version of the __netcat.py__ tool with the privilege level of the originating service. There is a vast array of nasty things you can do with these VBScript, batch, and PowerShell files. We'll create the general framework, and you can run wild from there. Modify the __file_monitoring.py__ script and add the following code after the file modification constants:\n",

The __NETCAT__ variable gives the location of the Netcat substitute we coded in Chapter 2. If you haven't created an executable from that code, you can do so now:\n",
