Philippe Biondin has created such a library in the packet manipulation library __Scapy__. You just might finish this chapter and realize we made you do a lot of work in the previous two chapters to accomplish what you could have done with just one or two lines of Scapy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scapy is powerful and flexible, and its possibilities are almost infinite. We'll get a taste of things by sniffing traffic to steal plaintext email credentials and then __ARP poisoning__ a target machine on the network so that we can sniff their traffic. We'll wrap things up by extending Scapy's __pcap processing__ to carve out images from HTTP traffic and then perform facial detection on them to determine if there are humans present in the images.\n",

The newest version of Scapy does support Winzozz, but for the purpose of this chapter we will assume you are using your Kali virtual machine (__VM__) with a fully functioning Scapy installation. If you don't have Scapy, head on over to https://scapy.net/ to install it.\n",

We'll build a very simple sniffer to capture Simple Mail Transport Protocol (__SMTP__), Post Office Protocol (__POP3__), and Internet Message Access Protocol (__IMAP__) credentials. Later, by coupling the sniffer with the Address Resolution Protocol (__ARP__) poisoning man-in-the-middle (__MITM__) attack, we can easily steal credentials from other machines on the network. This technique can, of course, be applied to any protocol, or to simply suck in all traffic and store it in a pcap file for analysis, which we will also demonstrate.\n",

The __iface__ parameter tells the sniffer which network interface to sniff on, if it is left blank, Scapy will sniff on all interfaces. The __prn__ parameter specifies a callback function to be called for every packet tha matches the filter, and the callback function receives the packet object as its single parameter.

We changed the __sniff__ function to add a BPF filter that includes only the traffic destined for the common mail ports 110 (__POP3__), 143 (__IMAP__), and 25 (__SMTP__) __[4]__. We also used a new parameter called __store__, which, when set to 0, ensures that Scapy isn't keeping the packets in memory. It's a good idea to use this parameter if you intend to leave a long-term sniffer running, because then you won't be consuming vast amounts of RAM.
