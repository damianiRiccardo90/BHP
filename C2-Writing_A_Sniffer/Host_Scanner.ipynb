ICMP messages can vary greatly in their contents, but each message contains three elements that stay consistent: The type, code, and checksum fields. The type and code fields tell the receiving host what type of ICMP message is arriving, which then dictates how to decode it properly.\n",

Refer to __Figure 3-3__ for a diagram of a __Destination Unreachable__ ICMP message.\n",
