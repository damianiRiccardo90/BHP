The information is packed into binary form and, as shown previously, is quite difficult to understand. Let's work on decoding the IP portion of a packet so that we can pull useful information from it, such as the protocol type (__TCP__, __UDP__, or __ICMP__) and the source and destination IP addresses. This will serve as a foundation for further protocol parsing later on.\n",
