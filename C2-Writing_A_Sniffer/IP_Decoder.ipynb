        "In its current form, our sniffer receives all of the __IP headers__, along with any higher protocols such as __TCP__, __UDP__, or __ICMP__. The information is packed into binary form and, as shown previously, is quite difficult to understand. Let's work on decoding the IP portion of a packet so that we can pull useful information from it, such as the protocol type (__TCP__, __UDP__, or __ICMP__) and the source and destination IP addresses. This will serve as a foundation for further protocol parsing later on.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, there are a couple of ways to get external binary data into a data structure. You can use either the __ctype__ module or the __struct__ module to define the data structure. The __ctype__ module is a foreign function library for Python. It provides a bridge to C-based languages, enabling you to use C-compatible data types and call functions in shared libraries. On the other hand, __struct__ converts between Python values and C structs represented as Python byte object. In other words, the __ctype__ module handles binary data types in addition to providing a lot of other functionalities, while the __struct__ module primarily handles binary data.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will see both methods used when you explore tool repositories on the web. This esction shows you how to use each one to read an __IPv4 header__ off the network. It's up to you to decide which method you prefer, either will work fine."

        "This class creates a __\\_fields\\___ structure to define each part of the IP header. The structure uses C types that are defined in the __ctypes__ module. For example, the __c_ubyte__ type is an unsigned char, the __c_ushort__ type is an unsigned short, and so on. You can see that each field matches the IP header diagram in __Figure 3-1__. Each field description takes three arguments: The name of the field (such as __ihl__ or __offset__), the type of value it takes (such as __c_ubyte__ or __c_ushort__), and the width in bits for that field (such as 4 for __ihl__ and __version__). Being able to specify the bit width is handy because it provides the freedom to specify any length we need, not only at the byte level (specification at the byte level would force our defined fields to always be a multiple of 8 bits).\n",
        "\n",
        "The IP class inherits from the __ctypes__ module's __Structure__ class, which specifies that we must have a defined __\\_fields\\___ structure before creating any object. To fill the __\\_fields\\___ structure, the __Structure__ class uses the __\\_new\\___ method, which takes the class reference as the first argument. It creates and returns an object of the class, which passes to the __\\_init\\___ method. When we create our IP object, we'll do so as we ordinarily would, but underneath, Python invokes __\\_new\\___, which fills out the __\\_fields\\___ data structure immediately before the object is created (when the __\\_init\\___ method is called). As long as you've defined the structure beforehand, you can just pass the __\\_new\\___ method the external network packet data, and the fields should magically appear as your object's attributes.\n",

        "You now have an idea of how to map the C data types to the IP header values. Using C code as a reference when translating to Python objects can be useful, because the conversion to pure Python is seamless. See the __ctypes__ documentation for full details about working with this module."
