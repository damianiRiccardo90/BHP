The information is packed into binary form and, as shown previously, is quite difficult to understand. Let's work on decoding the IP portion of a packet so that we can pull useful information from it, such as the protocol type (__TCP__, __UDP__, or __ICMP__) and the source and destination IP addresses. This will serve as a foundation for further protocol parsing later on.\n",

On the other hand, __struct__ converts between Python values and C structs represented as Python byte object.

For example, the __c_ubyte__ type is an unsigned char, the __c_ushort__ type is an unsigned short, and so on. You can see that each field matches the IP header diagram in __Figure 3-1__. Each field description takes three arguments: The name of the field (such as __ihl__ or __offset__), the type of value it takes (such as __c_ubyte__ or __c_ushort__), and the width in bits for that field (such as 4 for __ihl__ and __version__). Being able to specify the bit width is handy because it provides the freedom to specify any length we need, not only at the byte level (specification at the byte level would force our defined fields to always be a multiple of 8 bits).\n",

It creates and returns an object of the class, which passes to the __\\_init\\___ method. When we create our IP object, we'll do so as we ordinarily would, but underneath, Python invokes __\\_new\\___, which fills out the __\\_fields\\___ data structure immediately before the object is created (when the __\\_init\\___ method is called). As long as you've defined the structure beforehand, you can just pass the __\\_new\\___ method the external network packet data, and the fields should magically appear as your object's attributes.\n",

This leaves us with only the first nybble of the original byte. The Python code essentially does the following:\n",

This applies the Boolean operation such that __0 AND 1__ produce 0 (since 0 is equivalent to __False__, and 1 is equivalent to __True__). For the expression to be true, both the first part and the last part must be true. Therefore, this operation deletes the first 4 bits, as anything ANDed with 0 will be 0. It leaves the last 4 bits unaltered, as anything ANDed with 1 will return the original value. Essentially, the Python code manipulates the byte as follows:\n",

        "In cases like this that require some bit-shifting, decoding binary data takes some effort. But for many cases (such as reading __ICMP__ messages), it's very simple to set up: Each portion of the __ICMP__ message is a multiple of 8 bits, and the format characters provided by the __struct__ module are multiples of 8 bits, so there's no need to split a byte into separate nybbles.
