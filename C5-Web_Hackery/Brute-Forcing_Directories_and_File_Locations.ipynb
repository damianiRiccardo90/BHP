But in a lot of cases, you'll want to get ahold of configuration files, leftover development files, debugging scripts, and other security bread-crumbs that can provide sensitive information or expose functionality that the software developer did not intend. The only way to discover this content is to use a brute-forcing tool to hunt down common filenames and directories.\n",

You'll find many word lists available on the internet, and you already have quite a few in your Kali distribution (see _/usr/share/wordlists_). For this example, we'll use a list from SVNDigger.

        "The __get_words__ helper function __[1]__, which returns the words queue we'll test on the target, contains some special techniques. We read in a word list file __[4]__ and then begin iterating over each line in the file. We then set the __resume__ variable to the last path that the brute forcer tried __[5]__. This functionality allows us to resume a brute-forcing session if our network connectivity is interrupted or the target site goes down. When we've parsed the entire file, we return a __Queue__ full of words to use in our actual brute-forcing function __[6]__.\n",

In some cases, you want to try not only the __/admin__ extension, for example, but also __admin.php__, __admin.inc__, and __admin.html__ __[3]__. It can be useful here to brainstorm common extensions that developers might use and forget to remove later on, like __.orig__ and __.bak__, on top of the regular programming language extensions. The __extend_words__ inner function provides this capability, using these rules: If the word contains a dot (_._), we'll append it to the URL (for example, __/test.php__), otherwise, we'll treat it like a directory name (such as __/admin/__).\n",
