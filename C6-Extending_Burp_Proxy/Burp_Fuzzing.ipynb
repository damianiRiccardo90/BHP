        "\n",
        "If you've ever tried hacking a web application, you've likely used __Burp Suite__ to perform spidering, proxy browser traffic, and carry out other attacks. Burp Suite also allows you to create your own tooling, called __extensions__. Using Python, Ruby, or pure Java, you can add panels in the Burp GUI and build automation techniques into Burp Suite. We'll take advantage of this feature to write some handy tooling for performing attacks and extended reconnaissance. The first extension will use an intercepted and extended reconnaissance. The first extension will use an intercepted HTTP request from Burp Proxy as a seed for a mutation fuzzer that runs in Burp Intruder. The second extension will communicate with the Microsoft Bing API to show us all virtual hosts located on the same IP address as a target site, as well as any subdomains detected for the target domain. Finally, we'll build an extension to create a word list from a target website that you can use in a brute-force password attack.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter assumes that you've played with Brup before and know how to trap requests with the Proxy tool, as well as how to send a trapped request to Burp Intruder. If you need a tutorial on how to do these tasks, visit PortSwigger Web Security (_http://www.portswigger.net/_) to get started.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have to admit that when we first started exploring the Burp Extender API, it took us some time to understand how it worked. We found it a bit confusing, as we're pure Python guys and have limited Java development experience. But we found a number of extensions on the Burp website that taught us how other folks had developed extensions. We used that prior art to help us understand how to begin implementing our own code. This chapter will cover some basics on extending functionality, but we'll also show you how to use the API documentation as a guide."

Up until now, all of our code has used Python 3 syntax, but in this chapter we'll revert to Python 2, since that's what Jython expects. You can find this JAR file on the official site, _https://www.jython.org/download.html__. Select the Jython 2.7 Standalone Installer. Save the JAR file to an easy to remember location, such as your Desktop.\n",

        "\n",
        "At some point in your career, you may find yourself attacking a web application or service that doesn't allow you to use traditional web application assessment tools. For example, the application might use too many parameters, or it may be obfuscated in some way that makes performing a manual test far too time consuming. We've been guilty of running standard tools that can't deal with strange protocols, or even JSON in a lot of cases. This is where you'll find it useful to establish a solid baseline of HTTP traffic, including authentication cookies, while passing off the body of the request to a custom fuzzer. This fuzzer can then manipulate the payload in any way you choose. We'll work on our first Burp extension by creating the world's simplest web application fuzzer, which you can then expand into something more intelligent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Burp has a number of tools you can use when you're performing web application tests. Typically, you'll trap all requests using the _Proxy_, and when you see an interesting one, you'll send it to another Burp tool. A common technique is to send them to the _Repeater_ tool, which lets you replay web traffic as well as manually modify any interesting spots. To perform more automated attacks in query parameters, you can send a request to the _Intruder_ tool, which attempts to automatically figure out which areas of the web traffic you should modify and then allows you to use a variety of attacks to try to elicit error messages or tease out vulnerabilities. A Burp extension can interact in numerous ways with the Burp suite of tools. In our case, we'll bolt additional functionality directly onto the Intruder tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our first instinct is to take a look at the Burp API documentation to determine what Burp classes we need to extend in order to write our custom extension. You can access this documentation by clicking the __Extender__ tab and then clicking the __APIs__ tab. The API can look a little daunting because it's very Java-y. But notice that the Burp developers have aptly named each class, making it easy to figure out where we want to start. In particular, because we're trying to fuzz web requests during an Intruder attack, we might want to focus on the __IIntruderPayloadGeneratorFactory__ and __IIntruderPayloadGenerator__ classes.

Once the counter reaches the maximum level, we'll return _False_ to stop generating fuzzing cases. The __getNextPayload__ method __[2]__ will receive the original payload from the HTTP request that you trapped. Alternatively, if you selected multiple payload areas in the HTTP request, you'll receive only the bytes you plan to fuzz (more on this later). This method allows us to fuzz the original test case and then return it for Burp to send. The last method, __reset__ __[3]__, is there so that if we generate a known set of fuzzed requests, the fuzzer can iterate through those values for each payload position designated in the Intruder tab.
