        "If you've ever tried hacking a web application, you've likely used __Burp Suite__ to perform spidering, proxy browser traffic, and carry out other attacks. Burp Suite also allows you to create your own tooling, called __extensions__. Using Python, Ruby, or pure Java, you can add panels in the Burp GUI and build automation techniques into Burp Suite. We'll take advantage of this feature to write some handy tooling for performing attacks and extended reconnaissance. The first extension will use an intercepted and extended reconnaissance. The first extension will use an intercepted HTTP request from Burp Proxy as a seed for a mutation fuzzer that runs in Burp Intruder. The second extension will communicate with the Microsoft Bing API to show us all virtual hosts located on the same IP address as a target site, as well as any subdomains detected for the target domain. Finally, we'll build an extension to create a word list from a target website that you can use in a brute-force password attack.\n",

        "This chapter assumes that you've played with Brup before and know how to trap requests with the Proxy tool, as well as how to send a trapped request to Burp Intruder. If you need a tutorial on how to do these tasks, visit PortSwigger Web Security (_http://www.portswigger.net/_) to get started.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have to admit that when we first started exploring the Burp Extender API, it took us some time to understand how it worked. We found it a bit confusing, as we're pure Python guys and have limited Java development experience. But we found a number of extensions on the Burp website that taught us how other folks had developed extensions. We used that prior art to help us understand how to begin implementing our own code. This chapter will cover some basics on extending functionality, but we'll also show you how to use the API documentation as a guide."
