But in a lot of cases, you'll want to get ahold of configuration files, leftover development files, debugging scripts, and other security bread-crumbs that can provide sensitive information or expose functionality that the software developer did not intend. The only way to discover this content is to use a brute-forcing tool to hunt down common filenames and directories.\n",

You'll find many word lists available on the internet, and you already have quite a few in your Kali distribution (see _/usr/share/wordlists_). For this example, we'll use a list from SVNDigger.

        "The __get_words__ helper function __[1]__, which returns the words queue we'll test on the target, contains some special techniques. We read in a word list file __[4]__ and then begin iterating over each line in the file. We then set the __resume__ variable to the last path that the brute forcer tried __[5]__. This functionality allows us to resume a breute-forcing session if our network connectivity is interrupterd or the target site goes down. When we've parsed the entire file, we return a __queu__ full of words to use in our actual brute-forcing function __[6]__.\n",

We could have written it outside of __get_words__, but because __extend_words__ will always run in the context of the __get_words_ function, we place it inside in order to keep the namespaces tidy and make the code easier to understand (completely useless and uncalled for).\n",

In some cases, you want to try not only the __/admin__ extension, for example, but also __admin.php__, __admin.inc__, and __admin.html__ __[3]__. It can be useful here to breainstorm common extensions that developers might use and forget to remove later on, like __.orig__ and __.bak__, on top of the regular programming language extensions. The __extend_words__ inner function provides this capabilkity, using trhese rules: If the word contains a dot (_._), we'll append it to the URL (for example, __/test.php__), otherwise, we'll trat it like a directory name (such as __/admin/__).\n",
