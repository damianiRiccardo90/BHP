        "The previous example assumed a lot of knowledge about your target. But when you're attacking a custom web application or large e-commerce system, you often won't be aware of all the files accessible on the web server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generally, you'll deploy a spider, such as the one included in _Burp Suite_, to crawl the target website in order to discover as much of the web application as possible. But in a lot of cases, you'll want to get ahold of configuration files, leftover development files, debugging scripts, and other security bread-crumbs that can provide sensitive information or expose functionality that the software developer did not intend. The only way to discover this content is to use a brute-forcing tool to hunt down common filenames and directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll build a simple tool that will accept word lists from common brute forcers, such as the __gobuster__ project (_https://github.com/OJ/gobuster/_) and __SVNDigger__ (_https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/svn-digger-better-lists-for-forced-browsing/_), and attempt to discover directories and files that are reachable on the target web server. You'll find many word lists available on the internet, and you already have quite a few in your Kali distribution (see _/usr/share/wordlists_). For this example, we'll use a list from SVNDigger. You can retrieve the files for SVNDigger as follows:\n",

        "```\n",
        "When you unzip this file, the file __all.txt__ will be in your __Downloads__ directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "As before, we'll create a pool of threads to aggressively attempt to discover content. Let's start by creating some functionality to create a __Queue__ out of a word-list file. Open up a new file, name it __bruter.py__, and enter the following code:"
