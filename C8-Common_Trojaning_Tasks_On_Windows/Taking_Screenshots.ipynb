        "Let's review what this little script does. We acquire a handle to the entire desktop __[2]__, which includes the entire viewable area across multiple monitors. We then determine the size of the screen (or screens) __[1]__ so that we know the dimensions required for the screenshot. We create a device context using the __GetWindowDC__ __[3]__ function call and pass in a handle to the desktop. (Learn more about device contexts and GDI programming on the Microsoft Developer Network [__MSDN__] at https://msdn.microsoft.com.) Next, create a memory-based device context __[4]__, where we'll store our image capture until we write the bitmap bytes to a file. We then create a bitmap object __[5]__ that is set to the device context of our desktop. The __SelectObject__ call then sets the memory-based device context to point at the bitmap object that we're capturing.\n",
        "We use the __BitBlt__ __[6]__ function to take a bit-for-bit copy of the desktop image and store it in the memory-based context. Think of this as a __memcpy__ call for GDI objects. The final step is to dump this image to disk __[7]__.\n",
        "\n",
        "This script is easy to test: Just run it from the command line and check the directory for your __screenshot.bmp__ file. You can also include this script in your Github command and control repo, since the __run__ function __[8]__ calls the __screenshot__ function to create the image and then reads and returns the file data.\n",
