        "Increasingly, antivirus solutions employ some form of sandboxing to determine the behavior of suspicious specimens. Regardless of whether this sandbox runs on the network perimeter, which is becoming more popular, or on the target machine itself, we must do our best to avoid tipping our hand to any defense in place on the target's network.\n",

        "We can use a few indicators to try to determine whether our trojan is executing within a sandbox. We'll monitor our target machine for recent user input. Then we'll add some basic intelligence to look for keystrokes, mouse clicks, and double-clicks. A typical machine has many user interactions on a day in which it has been booted, whereas a sandbox environment usually has no user interaction, because sandboxes are typically used as an automated malware analysis technique.\n",

        "Our script will also try to determine if the sandbox operator is sending input repeatedly (for instance, a suspicious, rapid succession of continuous mouse clicks) in order to try to respond to rudimentary sandbox detection methods. Finally, we'll compare the last time a user interacted with the machine versus how long the machine has been running, which should give us a good idea whther or not we are inside a sandbox.\n",

        "We define the necessary imports and create a __LASTINPUTINFO__ structure that will hold the timestamp, in milliseconds, of when the last input event was detected on the system. Next, we create a function, __get_last_input__, to determine the last time of input. Do note that you have to initialize the __cbSize__ __[1]__ variable to the size of the structure before making the call. We then call the __GetLastInputInfo__ function, which populates the __struct_lastinputinfo.dwTime__ field with the timestamp. The next step is to determine how long the system has been running by using the __GetTickCount__ __[2]__ function call. The elapsed time is the amount of time the machine has been running minus the time of last input. The last little snippet of code __[3]__ is simple test code that lets you run the script and then move the mouse, or hit a key on the keyboard, and see this new piece of code in action.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth noting that the total-running system time and the last-detected user input event can vary depending on your particular method of implantation. For example, if you've implanted your payload using a phishing tactic, it's likely that a user had to click a link or perform some other operation to get infected. This means that within the last minute or two, you'd see user input. But if you see that the machine has been running for 10 minutes and the last detected input was 10 minutes ago, you're likely inside a sandbox that has not processed any user input. These judgment calls are all part of having a good trojan that works consistently.\n",

        "You can use this same technique when polling the system to see whether or not a user is idle, as you may want to start taking screenshots only when they're actively using the machine. Likewise, you may want to transmit data or perform other tasks only when the user appears to be offline. You could also, for example, track a user over time to determine what days and hours they are typically online.\n",

        "Keeping this in mind, let's define three thresholds for how many of these user input values we'll have to detect before deciding that we're no longer in a sandbox. Delete the last three lines of test code and add some additional code to look at keystrokes and mouse clicks. We'll use a pure __ctypes__ solution this time, as opposed to the __PyWinHook__ method. You can easily use PyWinHook for this purpose as well, but having a couple of different tricks in your toolbox always helps, as each antivirus and sandboxing technology has its own way of spotting these tricks.

For example, it would be rather odd to see 100 double-clicks in a row during typical computer usage. If the maximum number of double-clicks has been reached and they happened in rapid succession __[7]__, we bail out.
