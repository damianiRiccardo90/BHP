        "When you deploy a trojan, you may want to perform a few common tasks with it: Grab keystrokes, take screenshots, and execute shellcode to provide an interactive session to tools like __CANVAS__ or __Metasploit__. This chapter focuses on performing these tasks on Windows systems. We'll wrap things up with some sandbox detection techniques to determine if we are running within an antivirus or forensics sandbox. These modules will be easy to modify and will work within the trojan framework developed in Chapter 7. In later chapters, we'll explore privilege escalation techniques that you can deploy with your trojan. Each technique comes with its own challenges and probability of being caught, either by the end user or an antivirus solution.\n",
        "We recommend that you carefully model your target after you've implanted your trojan so that you can test the modules in your lab before trying them on a live target. Let's get started by creating a simple keylogger."

It takes advantage of the native Windows function __SetWindowsHookEx__, which allows us to install a user-defined function to be called for certain Windows events. By registering a hook"
