        "Pivoting with __BHNET__, the __netcat__ replacement we built, is pretty handy, but sometimes it's wise to encrypt your traffic to avoid detection. A common means of doing so is to tunnel the traffic usi9ng __Secure Shell (__SSH__). But what if your target doesn't have an __SSH__ client, just like 99.81943 percent of Winzozz systems?\n",
        "\n",
        "While there are great __SSH__ clients available for __Winzozz__, like __PuTTY__, this is a book about Python. In Python, you could use raw sockets and some crypto magic to create your own __SSH__ client or server, but why create when you can reuse? __Paramiko__, which uses __PyCrypto__, gives you simple access to the __SSH2__ protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "To lrean about how this library works, we'll use __Paramiko__ to make a connection and run a command on an __SSH__ system, configure an __SSH__ server and __SSH__ client to run remote commands on a winzozz machine, and finally puzzle out the reverse tunnel demo file included with __Paramiko__ to duplicate the proxy option of __BHNET__. Let's begin.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, grab __Paramiko__ by using the __pip__ installer (or download it from [paramiko website](http://www.paramiko.org/)).\n",

        "pip install paramiko\n",
