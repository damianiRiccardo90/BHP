        "\n",
        "In the last section, we built a tool that allowed us to run commands by entering them into an SSH client on a remote SSH server. Another technique would be to use an __SSH Tunnel__. Instead of sending commands to the server, an SSH tunnel would send network traffic packaged inside of SSH, and the SSH server would unpackage and deliver it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine that you're in the following situation: You have remote access to an SSH server on an internal network, but you want access to the web server on the same network. You can't access the web server directly. The server with SSH installed does have access, but this SSH server doesn't have the tools you want to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to overcome this problem is to set up a __Forward SSH Tunnel__. This would allow you to, for example, run the command:\n",
        "```\n",
        "ssh -L 8008:web:80 rick@sshserver\n",
        "```\n",
        "to connect to the SSH server as the user __rick__ and set up port __8008__ on your local system. Anything you send to port 8008 will travel down the existing SSH tunnel to the SSH server, which would deliver it to the web server. __Figure 2-1__ shows this in action.\n",

        "That's pretty cool, but recall that not many Winzozz systems are running an SSH server service. Not all is lost, though. We can configure a __Reverse SSH Tunneling__ connection. In this case, we connect to our own SSH server from the Winzozz client in the usual fashion. Through that SSH connection, we also specify a remote port on the SSH server that gets tunneled to the local host and port, as shown in __Fugure 2-2__. We could use this local host and port, for example, to expose port 3389 to access an internal system using __Remote Desktop__ or to access another system that the Winzozz client can access (like the web server in our example).\n",
