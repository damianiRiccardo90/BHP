        "# *__ARP Cache Poisoning with Scapy__*\n",
        "\n",
        "ARP poisoning is one of the oldest yet most effective tricks in a hacker's toolkit. Quite simply, we will convince a target machine that we have become its gateway, and we will also convince the gateway that in order to reach the target machine, all traffic has to go through us. Every computer on a network maintains an __ARP cache__ that stores the most recent media access control (__MAC__) addresses matching the IP addresses on the local network. We'll poison this cache with entries that we control to achieve this attack. Because the Address Resolution Protocol, and ARP poisoning in general, is covered in numerous other materials, we'll leave it to you to do any necessary research to understand how this attack works at a lower level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we know what we need to do, let's put it into practice. When the authors tested this, we attacked a real Mac machine from a Kali VM. We have also tested this code against various mobile devices connected to a wireless access point, and it worked great. The first thing we'll do is check the ARP cache on the target Mac machine so we can see the attack in action later on. Examine the following to see how to inspect the ARP cache on your Mac:\n",

        "The _ifconfig_ command displays the network configuration for the specified interface (here, it's _en0_) or for all interfaces if you don't specify one. The output shows that the _inet_ (IPv4) address for the device is 192.168.1.193. Also listed are the MAC address (38:f9:d3:63:5c:48, labeled as _ether_) and a few IPv6 addresses. ARP poisoning works only for IPv4 addresses, so we'll ignore the IPv6 ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's see what the Mac has in its ARP address cache. The following shows what it thinks the MAC addresses are for its neighbors on the network:\n",

        "We can see that the IP address of the Kali machine belonging to the attacker __[1]__ is 192.168.1.203 and its MAC address is a4:5e:60:ee:17:5d. The gateway connects both attacker and victim machines to the internet. Its IP address __[2]__ is at 192.168.1.254 and its associated ARP cache entry has a MAC address of 20:e5:64:c0:76:d0. We will take note of these values because we can view the ARP cache while the attack is occurring and see that we have changed the gateway's registered MAC address. Now that we know the gateway and the target IP address, let's begin coding the ARP poisoning script. Open a new Python file, call it _arper.py_, and enter the following code. We'll start by stubbing out the skeleton of the file to give you a sense of how we'll construct the poisoner:"
